class
------
A class is a collection of related
variables and methods.
A class defines a new custom
datatype in Java.

Conceptually a class represents
a real life entity.

The member variables of the
class represent the characteristics
of the entity.

The member methods of the
class represent the operations
of the entity.

As an int is used by defining its
variables similarly a class is used 
by defining its objects.

Member Variable
---------------
Member variables are variables
that belong to the class.
They may be
* static
* non static (by default)

A non static member variable
is allocated inside every object
of the class.
...


Member Method
---------------
Member methods are methods
that belong to the class.
They may be
* static
* non static (by default)
...

Object
-------
An object is an entity that can
store and process data.
An object is an instance of a
class i.e. its datatype is a class.

this
----
this is a system defined formal
parameter for non static methods
of the class.

this is a reference of type current class.

this gets the address of the caller 
object of the method.

this is auto applied as a caller
object for other members used
inside the method.

this is a final reference i.e.
it cannot be modified.
