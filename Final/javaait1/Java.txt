Java is an Object Oriented
and Platform independent
programming language.
================================
Platform is the base on which
applications execute.
Generally the OS, HAL and Hardware 
acts as a platform.

A source code program is compiled and 
a binary file that is compatible with a 
particular platform, is generated.
===============================

Java Virtual Machine is a software
that acts as a platform for java 
applications. It uses the actual platform
(OS, HAL and Hardware) as its base.

All Java application execute on JVM.

A java source code program is compiled 
and a binary file that is compatible
with a Java Virtual Machine, is generated.

So a java applications binary file can 
execute on any JVM which is installed 
on any OS.

Hence java programs become platform 
indepedent.
===============================

What is bytecode file?
Its a binary file generated by
compiling a java program. It is
JVM compatible file and JVM 
ensures that it runs on any O/S.

Hence we can say that it is a 
cross platform executable file.
================================
OOP
Object Oriented Programming is
an approach to application development
where we implement

* Encapsulation
Is binding of code and data into
one unit.

* Polymorphism

* Inheritance

* Abstraction
