Applets are java programs that are
* Embedded in a web page.
* Executed by a web browser.

A web server hosts web applications that 
are collection of web pages, applets, etc.

As a web client (browser) requests a
web page that has an applet embedded,
then in response the web server transmits
the web page and the applet as well.

Next the web browser 
* Renders the web page.
* Loads the applet in memory.
* Begins execution of applets life cycle methods.

Applet Life Cycle Methods
========================
The following 4 methods define the
applets life cycle.
* public void init()
* public void start()
* public void stop()
* public void destroy()

init
----
init is the applets life cycle method
that is executed first and only once 
by  the web browser.

It is invoked after applet gets loaded
in memory.
 
Use it for initialization purpose, something
similar to a constructor.

start
-----
start is the applets life cycle method
that is invoked by the browser :
* Once after init.
* Everytime as the web page is revisited.

Use it for on visit activity.
example : can begin multithreading.

stop
-----
stop is the applets life cycle method
that is invoked by the browser :
* Once before destroy.
* Everytime as the web page is left.

Use it for on page-leave activity.
example : can stop multithreading.

destroy
-------
destroy is the applets life cycle method
that is executed last and only once by 
the web browser.

As browsers memory management 
algorithm decides to remove the applet
from memory then just before the
unload browser invokes destroy.
 
Use it for resourse clean up purpose.

To make an applet
------------------
1) Define a public class that extends Applet.
2) Define necessary life cycle methods.
3) Define necessary member variables and methods.
4) Embed it in a web page
